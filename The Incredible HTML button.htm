<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Ruins Of Eridia</h1>
<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Hi and thanks for dropping by on this website. My name, as you may already know, is SquareEyedGamer, and I am creating a few games that a few of you people may be interested in. Ruins Of Eridia is an RPG videogame that focuses on a new way of fighting. </h4>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> About </h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Ruins Of Eridia is an RPG videogame that focuses on a new way of fighting. The player controls a child who is set out the task of discovering the Gatekeeper OF Eridia, who years before, along with a close friend, stole two pills of immortality, consumed them, and became immortal, then escaping from Eridia to found humanity. The Gatekeeper eventually went back to the mysterious city of Eridia, and the friend dissapeared. The player must extract the power from the Gatekeeper and share the formula with humanity, so that they, as well as the rest of humanity can become immortal. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Enemies/Friends?</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Along your journey through Eridia, you may find strange creatures such as Steelspear and his brother Rusty, both robots created in the Gatekeeper's spare time, and the terrifying Squamatadactyls, a race of dinosaurs (if you could call them that) who look like they have been created from the trash of Eridia. And remember to be wary of the guide. He may seem like a friendly character at first, but what you can see on the outside, may not always make up for what is on the inside...

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Help</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">In the demo - available now  - pressing quit will activate a boss battle that is a short demonstration of a boss fight that may or may not be similar to one available in the full game. As well as the demo boss fight, there is a Boss Test that will put you against the Steelspear, who will be fought in Chapter 10.</p>
